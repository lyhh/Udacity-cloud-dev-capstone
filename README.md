# Capstone project: Serverless TODOs App
Dear Udacity mentor,

In this capstone project, I reuse project 4 Serverless TODO app with refined UI and additional feature.

## New features
### Improve UI
- Refine UI layout
- Add UI items for pagination
- Change row color when marked done

![Alt text](images/Uda-Capstone-1.png?raw=true "New UI layout")

### Pagination feature
Implement pagination feature

## Frontend
Same as in project 4, run the following commands to run a client application:
```
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```
This should start a development server with the React application that will interact with the serverless TODO application.

# Thank you for reviewing
