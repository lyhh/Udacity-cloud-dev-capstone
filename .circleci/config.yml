orbs:
  # The Node.js orb contains a set of prepackaged CircleCI configuration you can utilize
  # Orbs reduce the amount of configuration required for common tasks.
  # See the orb documentation here: https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/node
  node: circleci/node@5.1.0
  aws-cli: circleci/aws-cli@1.0
  serverless-framework: circleci/serverless-framework@2.0

jobs:
  # Below is the definition of your job to build and test your app, you can rename and customize it as you want.
  backend-build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:16.10  
    executor: serverless-framework/default
    working_directory: ~/backend      
    # Then run your tests!
    # CircleCI will report the results back to your VCS provider.
    steps:
      # Checkout the code as the first step.
      - checkout
      - aws-cli/install
      - aws-cli/setup
      - serverless-framework/setup    
      # Next, the node orb's install-packages step will install the dependencies from a package.json.
      # The orb install-packages step will also automatically cache them for faster future runs.
      # - node/install-packages:
      #     # If you are using yarn, change the line below from "npm" to "yarn"
      #     pkg-manager: npm

workflows:
  # Below is the definition of your workflow.
  # Inside the workflow, you provide the jobs you want to run, e.g this workflow runs the build-and-test job above.
  # CircleCI will run this workflow on every commit.
  # For more details on extending your workflow, see the configuration docs: https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference/#workflows
  backend:
    jobs:
      - backend-build
      # For running simple node tests, you could optionally use the node/test job from the orb to replicate and replace the job above in fewer lines.
      # - node/test
